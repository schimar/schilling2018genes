# Code to accompany Schilling et al. (2018) Genes. Transitions from single to multi-locus processes during speciaion

This repository contains the code used for downstream analyses of forward-time simulations with [bu2s](https://github.com/flaxmans/bu2s/) and analyses of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in *Heliconius* butterflies. The repo is structured as follows:

* sims/		R code for *bu2s* downstream analyses and figures 
* hts/		scripts for filtering of *Heliconius* resequencing data and estimation of mean genotypes
* heliconius/	R code for figures and calculations of correlation coefficients between pairs of loci for different types of loci
